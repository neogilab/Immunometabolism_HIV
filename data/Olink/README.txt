The file checksum_sha256.txt is included in this zip package to be able to verify that the csv file is
complete and doesn't contain any errors after the download. It includes a SHA256 checksum which is a sequence of numbers and
letters and acts as a fingerprint for the csv file.

How to verify on Windows 10

   in automatically when you press tab.

5. Press the space button, type "SHA256" without quotes and press Enter

6. Compare checksums. Detailed instructions:
